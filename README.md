## 👋🏻 Introduction

This repository is helping [Darren Hickling] learn Rust!

## 📦 Dependencies

You will need to install the following:

1. [Rust]: a language empowering everyone
1. [UPX]: the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables to build reliable and efficient software.

You can follow the links to install these or try using my [Setup] scripts.

## 🏃🏻 Running

Use the controls within Rust `.rs` files within [Visual Studio Code], or use the `cargo run` command in a terminal.

To produce an optimal release build, run `.\build.ps1` on Windows.
